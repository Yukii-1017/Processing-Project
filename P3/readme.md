## Catching Stars

This project is an infinite jumping action game named Catching Stars. 

The player is a red matchstick man, who has the dream to climb to the sky and get all the stars. The player is here to make its dream comes true. The matchstick man can be controlled while jumping - going left or right after the user presses the “Space” key that makes the first jump. 

After leaving the ground the player will automatically jump higher every time when it catches a star. While it's a hard nut to crack. There will be several difficulties at different heights in the path towards the sky, including the smaller stars, the flying stars, the bombs and even the missles. But also, there are rewards along with them, like the lucky score star which has times of payoff and the reborn star helps to climb higher. 

In addition, players may die in different ways, like moving out of the boundaries, falling on the ground or falling too much. But the higher you climb and the more stars you catched will contribute to a better score. You can restart anytime and do it again after one game. 

It’s a long journey till death, similar to life where we can not stop time and there will always be things we have to face. The only goal of this game is to get a higher score on every try.
